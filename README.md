# InfoDrops: A Community Information Beacon

A discrete, solar-powered device for sharing critical information when the internet isn't an option.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Legal and Ethical Notice

**This project is for educational and legitimate resistance purposes only.** Its goal is to provide access to information during emergencies, connectivity outages, or periods of information suppression.

**Your Responsibilities:**

1. **Comply with local laws.** You are solely responsible for how you use this device.
2. **Use for peaceful purposes only.** This tool is for sharing information, not inciting violence.
3. **Respect property.** Do not deploy on private property without permission.
4. **Prioritize safety.** Never deploy a device if it puts you or your community at risk.

## üéØ Mission

To empower communities with access to vital, offline information during a crisis. InfoDrops creates a network of discrete, solar-powered beacons to support **democratic education**, **community organizing**, **emergency preparedness**, and **digital rights**.

## üîß How It Works

Think of an InfoDrop as a tiny, digital lighthouse. It requires no internet connection. When you're nearby, you connect to its free Wi-Fi, and a webpage automatically opens on your phone with the stored information.

- **The Device**: A tiny, low-power `ESP32-C3` microcontroller creates a local Wi-Fi network.
- **The Portal**: This network uses a **captive portal**‚Äîthe same technology hotels and airports use for Wi-Fi logins‚Äîto automatically direct your phone's browser to the locally-stored content.
- **The Power**: It can be powered by a simple USB power bank for portable use or a small solar panel for long-term, autonomous deployment.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Hardware Required

| Component                  | Portable Setup (Basic) | Deployed Setup (Advanced) | Purpose                                      |
| -------------------------- | :--------------------: | :-----------------------: | -------------------------------------------- |
| **ESP32-C3 SuperMini**     |      **Required**      |       **Required**        | The brain of the device.                     |
| **USB-C Power Bank**       |      **Required**      |         Optional          | Easy, portable power source.                 |
| **Solar Panel & Battery**  |           -            |       **Required**        | For long-term, autonomous operation.         |
| **Light Sensor (LDR)**     |           -            |         Optional          | Activates device only during daylight hours. |
| **Weatherproof Enclosure** |           -            |         Optional          | Protects the device when installed outdoors. |

### 2. Software Setup

1. **Install** the [PlatformIO IDE extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) in VS Code.
2. **Clone** this project's repository to your computer.
3. **Upload Filesystem Image**: This step loads the web portal content (`index.html`, `style.css`, etc.) onto the device's memory.
4. **Compile & Upload Firmware**: This step loads the main program code onto the device.
5. **Activate**: Power on the device. It will begin broadcasting a Wi-Fi network named **"A_Free_Community"**.

## üì± Usage Modes

You can use the device in two primary ways. Choose your mode by editing the `main.cpp` file before uploading the firmware.

| Mode          | Portable Mode (`USE_LIGHT_SENSOR = false`)                         | Deployed Mode (`USE_LIGHT_SENSOR = true`)                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**   | Temporary info sharing at events, meetings, or protests.           | Long-term, autonomous installations in public spaces.                      |
| **Power**     | USB power bank.                                                    | Solar panel and battery.                                                   |
| **Operation** | Runs continuously as long as it has power.                         | Activates automatically in daylight and sleeps at night to conserve power. |
| **Hardware**  | Just the ESP32-C3 and a power bank.                                | Requires a solar setup and an optional light sensor (LDR).                 |
| **Best For**  | Quick, mobile deployment where you can retrieve the device easily. | "Set it and forget it" deployments in a stable, secure location.           |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Safety & Legal Considerations

- **Public vs. Private Space**: Operating low-power Wi-Fi in public spaces is generally permissible, but always check local regulations. **Obtain permission for placement on private property.**
- **Operational Security (OpSec)**: For sensitive deployments, consider anonymous hardware purchases and take precautions to protect your identity.
- **Content is Key**: The default content focuses on legal resistance methods and educational resources. You are responsible for any content you add or modify. Ensure it complies with local laws and serves your community constructively.
- **No User Tracking**: The device is designed for privacy. It **does not log IP addresses or track user activity**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

1. **Edit Content**: Modify the files in the `data/` folder. The main page is `index.html`.
2. **Change Styles**: Customize the look and feel by editing `data/minimal.css`.
3. **Add Files**: Add images, PDFs, and other resources into the `data/` folder. Remember to update the filesystem image after making changes.
