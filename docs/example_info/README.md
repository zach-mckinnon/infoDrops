## Customization Guide

### Adapting Content

1. **Keep the HTML Structure**: Maintain the header, navigation, and section organization
2. **Modify Colors**: Change CSS color variables to match your theme
3. **Update Content**: Replace text while keeping the same HTML elements
4. **Add Sections**: Follow the existing pattern for new content blocks

### Creating New Pages

1. Copy one of the existing HTML files as a template
2. Update the `<title>` and navigation elements
3. Modify the CSS color scheme in the `<style>` section
4. Replace content while maintaining mobile-responsive structure
5. Test on both desktop and mobile devices

### CSS Customization

```css
/* Main theme colors - customize these */
--primary-color: #c2410c; /* Orange theme */
--secondary-color: #0284c7; /* Blue theme */
--background: #f8f7f4; /* Warm neutral */
--text-color: #1c1917; /* Dark gray */
```

### Avoid

- Overly academic or theoretical content
- Partisan political messaging

- Complex interactive features that drain battery

## Technical Specifications

### File Sizes

- `community_cohesion.html`: ~32KB (practical toolkit)
- Both include embedded CSS and JavaScript

### Browser Compatibility

- Works on all modern mobile browsers
- Optimized for captive portal environments
- Graceful degradation for older devices
- ESP32-specific performance optimizations

### Memory Usage

- Minimal JavaScript for smooth scrolling and mobile optimization
- CSS embedded to reduce HTTP requests

## Usage in Deployment

These examples can be used:

1. **As-is** for educational deployments about authoritarianism and community building
2. **As templates** for creating topic-specific information portals
3. **For testing** the mobile optimization and user experience
4. **For training** others how to create effective InfoDrop content

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Both examples focus on:

- **Peaceful resistance** and legal methods of civic engagement

- **Community empowerment** rather than confrontational messaging
- **Privacy protection** and digital security best practices

The content is designed to inform and empower citizens while staying within legal bounds and promoting democratic values.
